r"""This module contains functionality related to ``curl`` commands.

It provides methods for creating/executing ``curl`` commands which mimic
the ``requests`` signatures.

This module has been mainly designed to be used in the ``Api`` module for
logging purposes.

The ``curl`` module could be also used as stand alone:

Example:

>>> import xyzspaces.curl as curl
>>> command = curl.get(url='https://xkcd.com/552/info.0.json')
['curl', '--request', 'GET', 'https://xkcd.com/552/info.0.json']
>>> curl.execute(command)

Now I don\'t.\\nWoman: Sounds like the class helped.\\nMan: Well, maybe.\\n{{Title text: Correlation doesn\'t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing \'look over there\'.}}", "alt": "Correlation doesn\'t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing \'look over there\'.", "img": "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png", "title": "Correlation", "day": "6"}'  # noqa: E501
