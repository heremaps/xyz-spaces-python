# Scripts

The scripts in this directory are usually run on CI/CD, but some can also be useful
outside that context.

- `build_docs.sh` to create the documentation.
- `check_xyz_platform.py` runs a smoke test to check if the XYZ platform is alive and kicking.
- `walk_spaces.py` can serve as a template for building a maintenance script walking over all spaces.
